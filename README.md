# IDSW Website Mockup

1. Download git repository, which is just all of my code
      - Green Code Button -> Download as Zip
2. Unzip folder to wherever you want it to be
3. Open Terminal
4. In terminal, go to Project Folder
   - Type: cd "pathname_of_unzipped_folder"
   - For me: cd "/Users/jerricawerner/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Personal/Projects/IDSW/IDSW Website/IDSW Website Mockup"
5. In terminal, set project folder as local server host
   - Type: python3 -m http.server 8000
6. In any browser you want (Safari, Chrome) open link: http://localhost:8000/IDSW%20Home%20Page.html

If you want to see updated code, then you need to re-download the repository and save it OVER the old folder (as in exact place, exact name) so that you don't have to reset up the local host.
